# vinhunter

This application allows for searching vehicle information by VIN. This application was built on Node.js and Express.js to improve my skills in these techonologies. I learned a great deal from this project and I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed building it.

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

##### Clone the git repo

##### Open package.json and install all dependencies from npm

##### Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the application

##### You will need to get an API key from `https://rapidapi.com/vinfreecheck/api/vin-decoder-1` and put 
##### the key in the `.env` file in the format `RAPID_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY`

##### Spin up a local express server in the terminal using `node app.js`

##### View the application at `http://localhost:3000/`
